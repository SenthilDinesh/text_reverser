# Text Reverser

## Project Overview
Text Reverser is a simple Python program that allows users to reverse text in two ways:
1. **Reverse Character Order** – Reverses the characters in the input string.
2. **Reverse Word Order** – Reverses the order of words while maintaining individual word spelling.

This project helps in understanding string manipulation, user input handling, and error management.

## Features
- Interactive menu for user selection.
- Handles empty input and special character validation.
- Uses Python string slicing and list operations for efficient text reversal.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.

## Requirements
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.

## Installation
Clone this repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-reverser.git

```

## Usage
Run the script using:
```bash
python text_reverser.py
```

Follow the interactive menu to choose an option:

## Example Usage
**Input:**
```

## Future Enhancements
